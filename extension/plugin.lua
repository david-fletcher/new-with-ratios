    -- PLUGIN COMMANDS
    -----------------------------------
    -- A plugin command is simply a menu element that, when clicked, runs the function passed to onclick.
    -- In this file, we specify menu element definitions, but abstract away their implementations to different Lua scripts.
    -- This is done for organizational purposes, and to ease the iterative development of scripts. With this structure,
    -- we can develop the script file independently of the plugin definition, using Aseprite's scripting engine
    -- to run scripts as we build out our functionality, then wrap the finalized scripts in a plugin.
    -----------------------------------
    -- We use the parameter to init, plugin, to access the preferences table. This table will be saved on exit and restored
    -- upon re-entry, so that you can easily save any user-defined preferences you need to. You will notice that we use
    -- loadfile() to create a Lua chunk based on our script, and then pass the preferences table to the script as an argument.
    -- The script can modify that table, which will then be saved automagically by Aseprite's API.
